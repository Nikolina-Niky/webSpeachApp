# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## First install dependencies:

npm install

## To run in the development:

npm run dev

## To run tests:

npm run test

That command opens http://localhost:5173/login page in your browser.
